                    <h5>Personal statment:</h5>
                    <p>I'm a passionate and driven web developer who thrives in creative,
                        collaborative environments. I believe in building websites that not only function beautifully
                        but also provide users with memorable experiences. Through my journey — from self-teaching HTML
                        in my bedroom to working with Hot Beans Web — I've developed strong technical skills in
                        front-end development, as well as the soft skills necessary for teamwork and project management.
                        I am constantly learning, improving, and pushing boundaries in design and usability. I'm excited
                        to continue growing as a developer and contribute to projects that make an impact. Whether it's
                        refining a user interface or bringing a brand's story to life online, I'm always ready for the
                        next challenge.

                    <h5>Personal statment:</h5>
                    <p>Web development is where logic meets creativity — and that's exactly why
                        I love it. I've always been fascinated by how a few lines of code can shape a whole online
                        experience. At Hot Beans Web, I found the perfect environment to blend technical skill with
                        artistic vision. During my time with the team, I worked on projects that demanded more than just
                        functionality. I
                        learned to think like a designer, code like a developer, and test like a user. Whether it was
                        creating responsive layouts or optimizing performance, I approached every task with a
                        problem-solving mindset and an eye for detail. My goal is to continue building intuitive,
                        engaging websites that make a difference — not just
                        for clients, but for users too. I'm always exploring new frameworks, experimenting with design
                        trends, and pushing myself to be a better, more well-rounded developer.</p>

                    <h5>Personal statment:</h5>
                    <p>I used to think web development was a solo journey — long nights of
                        coding and caffeine. But working at Hot Beans Web taught me that the best digital experiences
                        come from teamwork. Being part of a professional development team gave me more than technical
                        skills. I learned how
                        to collaborate effectively, communicate ideas clearly, and contribute to shared goals. I've
                        worked with designers, content creators, and back-end developers to bring websites to life — and
                        I've grown with every sprint, review, and deployment. Now, I see code as a language for
                        collaboration. I enjoy mentoring others, sharing knowledge,
                        and building not just great websites, but great teams too. I'm excited to keep growing,
                        learning, and creating together with others who share the same passion.

                <img src="Images/traineeproject1.jpg" alt="Trainee Projects" />
                <p>This website was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. The goal was to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information in a clean,
                    responsive
                    layout. I used Flexbox and media queries to ensure it looked great on all devices. Through this
                    project,
                    I
                    learned about page structure, design consistency, and how to make a website user-friendly.</p>

            <div class="projects">
                <img src="Images/traineeproject2.jpg" alt="Trainee Projects" />
                <p>I was tasked with creating a furniture and interiors website. I used Bootstrap
                    to speed up development and made use of pre-built components like carousels and modals. I also
                    added
                    animations with CSS and made sure the site passed basic accessibility checks. This project
                    helped me
                    understand real-world design requirements and taught me how to balance style with performance.

                <p>As a trainee at Hot Beans Web, I built a tech job recruitment site using HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It featured job listings, a filter system, and an application form
                    that
                    saved
                    data to a database. The site was fully responsive and designed to connect developers with hiring
                    companies. This project improved my full-stack skills and understanding of user-focused design.
